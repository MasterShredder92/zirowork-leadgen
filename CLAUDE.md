# ZiroWork Lead-Gen Platform

React 18 + Babel SPAs. No bundler. Supabase live.
**ONE repo** (`github.com/MasterShredder92/zirowork-leadgen`), **ONE Vercel project** (Root Directory `.`).
Surfaces, all in this repo, routed by root `vercel.json`:
operator CRM (`/`) · student landing pages (`/schools`) · client portal (`/dashboard`) · public self-serve onboarding (`onboard.html`).
Doctrine / SSOT: `ZiroWork-Client-Flow` + `94-knowledge/northstar-ideology.md`.

---

## Navigate First — No Skipping

1. Read this file (CLAUDE.md) — you are doing this now
2. Read root `CONTEXT.md` — routes your task to the correct folder
3. Read the target folder's `CONTEXT.md` — load list + guardrails
4. Load only the files listed there
5. Do the task. Nothing else.

**Cannot identify the correct folder? STOP AND ASK. Do not explore.**

---

## Non-Negotiable Rules

- **Do only what was asked.** No extra features, no cleanup, no "while I'm here."
- **Ask, don't assume.** Unclear? Stop and ask. Never fill gaps with defaults or guesses.
- **Load only what the task requires.** Each folder's CONTEXT.md has the load list.
- **Surgical edits only.** Touch only the file and lines the task requires.
- **Judgment is not permitted.** Rules are not suggestions. If not covered — stop and ask.

## Keep Docs In Sync (anti-stale)

These docs describe the repo and MUST be updated in the **same change** that makes them stale — that's part of "done," not optional:

| If you change… | Update… |
|---|---|
| operator folder structure, routing, globals, or surfaces | this `CLAUDE.md` (tree + tables) + `94-knowledge/architecture.md` |
| `schools/` · `dashboard/` · `onboard.html` · `vercel.json` routing | this `CLAUDE.md` + `README.md` |
| edge functions / backend layout in `99-agents/` | `99-agents/CONTEXT.md` (never alter agent names, voice, or brand speak) |
| a folder's files or load list | that folder's `CONTEXT.md` |

Each of these docs carries a `> Keep this in sync:` header. **A stale doc is a defect.**

## Repo Tree

One repo, one Vercel project (root dir `.`). Operator folder number = CRM sidebar nav position.

## Safety Gates

| File | Risk |
|---|---|
| `92-design/theme.js` | Breaks all themes globally — `window.T` used by every view |
| `index.html` script load order | New pages must load **before** `90-shell/Router.jsx` |
| `90-shell/Router.jsx renderMain()` | Duplicate route cases silently overwrite each other |
| `93-hooks/use-local-data.js` | `window.SEED_DATA` — all page views read from here |
| `vercel.json` (root) | Wrong/removed rewrite 404s `/schools` or `/dashboard` |
| `onboard.html` ↔ `02-onboarding/onboard-form.jsx` | Form shared by CRM onboarding view AND public onboard.html — edits hit both |
| `schools/index.html`, `dashboard/index.html` | Script `src`s are absolute (`/schools/…`, `/dashboard/…`) — keep the prefix or assets 404 |

---

## Key Globals

| Symbol | File | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `window.T` | `92-design/theme.js` | Theme tokens — used by every view |
| `window.SEED_DATA` | `93-hooks/use-local-data.js` | Dev seed data fallback |
| `window.currentUser` | `91-auth/Session.jsx` | `{ full_name, role, email }` |
| `window.currentOperator` | `91-auth/Session.jsx` | `{ name, label }` |
| `window.useOperatorContext` | `93-hooks/use-studio-context.js` | Operator identity hook |
| `window.useSupabaseTable` | `93-hooks/use-supabase-table.js` | Stub — warns + returns empty |
| `window.ComingSoon` | `90-shell/Header.jsx` | Fallback for unbuilt routes |
| `window.App` | `90-shell/Router.jsx` | Root component |
| `window.Root` | `91-auth/Session.jsx` | ReactDOM mount point |
